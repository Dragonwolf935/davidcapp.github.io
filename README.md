# My GitHub account is currently for school purposes, but used a personal address in hopes of continuing. School accounts tend to be deleted once you complete the program, and the GitHub account would be deleted along with it.
# The repository I created is for the assignments to come in the class. It is meant to store the completed assignments and then push towards the main GitHub server online.
# The steps taken to clone the repository onto my computer were: File, clone repository, and set the cloned repository to be saved in the GitHub folder.
