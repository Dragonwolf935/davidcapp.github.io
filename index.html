	<h1>My name is David Cappadoccia</h1>
	<p>I am currently learning how to code for a career in cybersecurity. 
	In my spare time I play video games. 
	I also like to travel.</p>
	<p>I once tried to get a degree in computer programming in order to
	get a job coding video games, but I had a string of bad teachers who
	gave the impression they were only there for a paycheck, or had no clue
	about coding, nor the desire to help when we asked for it.</p>
	<p>What got me back into learning to code are the signs of most of life
	going digital, and the rise of hackers and bad actors.</p>
